<h1>Module 5 Guided Lab - Creating an Amazon RDS Database</h1>
<h2>Lab overview and objectives</h2>
FYI: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html">What is Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)?</a><br><br>

Traditionally, creating a database can be a complex process that requires either a database administrator or a systems administrator. In the cloud, you can simplify this process by using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS).<br><br>
After completing this lab, you should be able to:<br>
<ul><li>Launch a database using Amazon RDS  
<li>Configure a web application to connect to the database instance</li></ul>
At the end of this lab, your architecture will look like the following example:<br>

<h2>Task 1: Creating an Amazon RDS database</h2>
In this task, you will create a MySQL database in your virtual private cloud (VPC). MySQL is a popular open source relational database management system (RDBMS), so there are no software licensing fees.<br><br>

‚ÄºÔ∏èWindows Users: Use Chrome or Firefox as your web browser for this lab. The lab instructions are not compatible with Internet Explorer because of a difference in the Amazon RDS console.<br><br>

1.In the search box to the right of  Services, search for and choose RDS to open the RDS console.<br>
2.Choose Create database<br>

3.Under Engine options, select MySQL.<br>
The options include several use cases, ranging from enterprise-class databases to Dev/Test systems. In the options, you might notice Amazon Aurora. Aurora is a MySQL-compatible system that was re-architected for the cloud. If your company uses large-scale MySQL or PostgreSQL databases, Aurora can provide enhanced performance.<br>

4.Set the templates and availability and durability options:<br>
<ul><li>Under the Templates section, select Dev/Test.
<li>Under the Availability and durability section, select Single DB instance</li></ul>
Note: the default Multi-AZ deployment option automatically creates a replica of the database in a second Availability Zone for High Availability, however in this lab that is not needed.<br>

5.Under the Settings section, configure these options:
<ul><li>DB instance identifier: inventory-db
<li>Username: admin
<li>Password: lab-password
<li>Confirm password: lab-password</li></ul>

6.Under the DB instance class section, configure these options:
<ul><li>Select Burstable classes (includes t classes).
<li>Select db.t3.micro</li></ul>

7.Under the Connectivity section, configure these options: 
<ul><li>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Lab VPC
<li>Existing VPC security groups: 
<ul><li>Choose DB-SG. It will be highlighted. 
<li>Remove the default security group.</li></ul></li></ul>

8.Expand the Additional configuration panel, then configure these settings:
<ul><li>Initial database name: inventory</li></ul>
  Note: This is the logical name of the database that will be used by the application.<br>
<ul><li>Clear (turn off) the Enable Enhanced monitoring option</li></ul>

üí¨Feel free to review the many other options displayed on the page, but leave them set to their default values. Options include automatic backups, the ability to export log files, and automatic version upgrades. The ability to activate these features through check boxes demonstrates the power of using a fully managed database solution instead of installing, backing up, and maintaining the database yourself.<br><br>

9.Choose Create database (at the bottom of the page).<br>
You should receive a message indicating that your database is being created.<br>
‚ÄºÔ∏èIf you receive an error message that mentions rds-monitoring-role, confirm that you have cleared (turned off) the Enhanced Monitoring option in the previous step, then try again.<br>
Before you continue to the next task, the database instance status must be Available. This process might take several minutes.

<h2>Task 2: Configuring web application communication with a database instance</h2>
10.This lab automatically deployed an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance with a running web application.<br>
You must use the IP address of the instance to connect to the application.<br>
